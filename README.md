# Zigbee <=> SUPLA gateway
This project is my personal attempt to build a gateway between various Zigbee end devices and SUPLA IoT ecosystem.

## SUPLA
[SUPLA](https://github.com/SUPLA)  is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) platform that empowers users to create their own smart home or automation systems. It offers a flexible and cost-effective way to control various devices remotely. The system is based on open software and hardware principles, encouraging community development and customization. Users can build their own devices using popular platforms like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP8266 and ESP32. These devices can then be connected to the Supla cloud or a self-hosted server via Wi-Fi or LAN.
One of the significant advantages of Supla is its open architecture. This fosters a large and active community of developers and enthusiasts who contribute to the platform's growth. The availability of source code on platforms like GitHub encourages innovation and allows users to tailor the system to their specific needs. Users also have the option to set up their own independent server for enhanced privacy and control.
## Zigbee
Zigbee is a low-power, low-cost wireless communication protocol designed for short-range data transfer in personal area networks. It operates on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and is well-suited for applications requiring long battery life and secure networking. A key feature of Zigbee is its mesh network topology, where devices can communicate with each other, extending the network range and improving reliability through multiple pathways. This makes it ideal for smart home applications like lighting control, security systems, and smart thermostats. Â  

Zigbee supports a large number of devices on a single network, often up to 65,000 nodes, making it highly scalable for extensive deployments. It offers reliable and secure communication with features like AES-128 encryption. Compared to other wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Zigbee typically consumes less power, which is crucial for battery-operated sensors and devices. Its cost-effectiveness and ease of installation have contributed to its widespread adoption in various IoT applications, including industrial automation and healthcare monitoring. The Zigbee Alliance (now the Connectivity Standards Alliance) continues to develop and promote the standard, ensuring interoperability between different manufacturers' devices.
